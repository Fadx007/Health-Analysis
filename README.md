# WATER POLLUTION AND DISEASE
## Introduction
Water quality is a critical determinant of public health, particularly in regions where access to clean drinking water is limited. Contamination of water sources by chemical, biological, and physical pollutants can lead to increased disease incidence, reduced quality of life, and negative socioeconomic impacts. This report presents a comprehensive analysis of water pollution and disease data, exploring trends, correlations, and potential causes across different countries and regions. The goal is to identify key environmental and socioeconomic factors that influence waterborne disease prevalence, with a focus on diarrheal diseases, cholera, and typhoid.

## Problem questions
1.	What is the average contaminant level (ppm) per country/year?
2.	What is the median pH, turbidity, nitrate, and lead concentration across all samples?
3.	Which water source type (river, well, tap, spring) has the highest contamination?
4.	What percentage of the population has access to clean water in each country?
5.	What is the national average for diarrheal, cholera, and typhoid cases?
6.	Which countries have the cleanest vs dirtiest water?
7.	Which countries have the highest vs lowest disease incidence rates?

## INSIGHTS
1.	Bangladesh has the highest average contaminant level of 5.17 ppm followed by Mexico at 5.16 ppm and least being Indonesia with 4.64 ppm. 2016 is the year with the highest average contaminant level of 5.52 ppm followed by 2012 at 5.38 ppm and the least being 2024 with 4.37 ppm. 
2.	The median pH is 7.28, median Turbidity is 2.46 NTU, Nitrate is 24.79mg/l, Lead Concentration 10.065 Âµg/L.
3.	River is the most contaminated water source with a contaminant level of 2664.58 ppm followed by Spring with a contaminant level of 2652.18 ppm and Tap with the least contaminant level of 2474.44 ppm. 
4.	China has the largest population percentage with access to clean water of 66.53% followed by Indonesia with 65.70% and the least being Pakistan with 63.39%.
5.	Mexico has the highest average cases for Diarrhea with 260.17 cases per 100,000 people and USA with the least average cases for Diarrhea at 239.97 cases per 100,000 people. China has the highest average cases for Cholera with 25.03 cases per 100,000 people and Brazil with the least average cases of Cholera at 22.56 cases per 100,000 people . Brazil has the highest average cases for Typhoid Fever with 53.36 cases per 100,000 people and India with the least average cases for Typhoid Fever at 46.82 cases per 100,000 people.
6.	Turbidity is mostly used to measure the degree of cleanliness or dirtiness of water. Nigeria has the average most clean water at 2.41 NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Unit) and Pakistan has the average least clean water with 2.60 NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Unit)
7.	Nigeria has the highest disease incidence cases with a total of 100,464 disease cases across Diarrhea, Cholera and Typhoid Fever and Bangladesh and Ethiopia has the lowest disease incidence cases with a total of 94,349 disease cases across Diarrhea, Cholera and Typhoid Fever.

## Recommendations
1.	Tap water should be used as the major form of drinking water so as to prevent predisposition to water borne diseases like Cholera, Diarrhea and Typhoid Fever.
2.	Country should endeavor to maintain water quality standards for potable water so as to prevent a water borne disease epidermic.
3.	Health facilities should be provided to reduce the mortality due to diseases caused by unclean water.
4.	The Public should be enlightened about the need for sanitation for their immediate environment so as to prevent these diseases.
5.	Countries like Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Mexico and Nigeria should provide more facilities to curb these diseases. And also, enforce laws concerning the need for sanitation and hygiene.
